For not it's a simple spreadsheet with single and double pokemon types. I MIGHT make a HTML version. Still not sure.

Based on [Single Type Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oq3rg/was_getting_frustrated_finding_an_easytoread_type/) and [Dual Type Chart](https://pokemondb.net/type/dual)

## Instructions
